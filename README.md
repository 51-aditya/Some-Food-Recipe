This recipe is about Pasta. White Sauce Pasta.The white sauce is also known as the béchamel sauce. 

Originally of Italian origin, the béchamel sauce is the standard white sauce. Immigrating from Tuscany, Italy to the royalty of France, the béchamel, previously named Balsamella, was easily adapted into the rich French cuisine. They renamed it after the chief steward to King Louis XIV, the marquis de Bechamel, and quickly found a number of delicious recipes to adapt it into. As the original cream sauce, béchamel is the basis of most anything cheese sauce you can think of—alfredo, the cheese of mac & cheese, mornya, natua and soubise. By starting with a roux and adding in some warmed milk, chopped onion and a clove or two, the end product is this thick, minimally spiced sauce that can be altered to your heart’s desire.
